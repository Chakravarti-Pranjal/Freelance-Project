                Founded in 1999 as Medisearch India, we initially provided top-tier staff to various business segments in India and abroad. In April 2008, we rebranded to Talent Track Services, reflecting our commitment to generating significant value and business impact for our clients. Since our inception, we have successfully offered fully integrated manpower services to multinational corporations and local conglomerates in both IT and Non-IT sectors.
